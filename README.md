## Graph Theorist's Sketchpad
# Functionality
1.  Graphical display of vertices and edges        
2.  Input of vertices and edges          
3.  Able to reposition vertices while maintaining adjacencies       
4.  Deletion of vertices and edges     
5.  Parallel edges    
6.  Loops 
7.  Ability to color vertices 
8.  Information about numbers of vertices and edges    
9.  Information about degrees of vertices
10. Number of components
11. Shows whether the graph is bipartite
12. Adjacency matrix

# Controls
left click in the drawing panel creates a new vertex

right click on a vertex or an edge selects it

right clicking a selected object deselects it

left clicking a vertex while another vertex is selected creates an edge between the two

click and drag moves a vertex
